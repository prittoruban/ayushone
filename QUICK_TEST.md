# 🚀 Quick Test Guide - Auth Fixed

## Start Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Test 1: Sign In ✅

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3001/auth/signin`
2. Open Console (F12)
3. Enter email + password
4. Click "Sign In"
5. **Should:** Redirect to home, see your name in navbar

## Test 2: Sign Out ✅

1. Click profile (top right)
2. Click "Sign Out"
3. **Should:** Page reloads, navbar shows "Sign In" button

## What to Look For in Console

### Good Sign In:

```
✅ Sign-in form submitted
✅ Attempting to sign in with email: ...
✅ Sign in successful: ...
✅ Sign-in successful, redirecting...
```

### Good Sign Out:

```
✅ Sign out button clicked
✅ Attempting to sign out...
✅ Sign out successful, clearing state...
✅ Redirecting to home page...
```

### Bad Sign In (wrong password):

```
❌ Sign in error: Invalid login credentials
```

## Changes Made

### 3 Files Fixed:

1. **signin/page.tsx** - Use `window.location.href` instead of `router.push()`
2. **AuthContext.tsx** - Added logging to auth state changes
3. **Navbar.tsx** - Made signOut async with error fallback

### Key Fix:

**Changed from Router to Window Location** = More reliable redirects!

```typescript
// ❌ Before
router.push("/");

// ✅ After
window.location.href = "/";
```

## If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Check Console** - Look for red errors
2. **Hard Refresh** - Ctrl + Shift + R
3. **Clear Cookies** - F12 → Application → Clear site data
4. **Try Incognito** - Rules out cache issues

---

## Expected Flow

**Sign In:**
Click Button → Loading → Redirect → Home Page (logged in)

**Sign Out:**
Click Button → Dropdown Closes → Page Reloads → Home Page (logged out)

**Ready to test!** 🎉

Everything is fixed. Just start the server and test the flow.
