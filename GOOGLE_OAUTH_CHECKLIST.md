## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Google Cloud Console Setup (5 minutes)

```
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create new project: "AYUSH ONE"
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Copy Client ID and Client Secret
```

**Redirect URIs to add:**

- Development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- Supabase: `https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### 2. Supabase Configuration (2 minutes)

```
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/
2. Navigate to: Authentication > Providers > Google
3. Toggle "Enabled"
4. Paste Client ID
5. Paste Client Secret
6. Click "Save"
```

### 3. Run Database Migration (1 minute)

```bash
# Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of supabase/migration_oauth_trigger.sql
3. Run the query

# Option 2: Via CLI (if installed)
supabase db push
```

### 4. Test It! (2 minutes)

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/auth/signin

# Click "Continue with Google"
```

## 📋 Configuration URLs

### Google Cloud Console

- Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- APIs & Services: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/
- Credentials: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

### Supabase Dashboard

- Project: https://app.supabase.com/
- Auth Providers: Authentication > Providers
- Database: Database > SQL Editor

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Never commit secrets** - Client ID/Secret only in Supabase
2. **Use HTTPS in production** - Required for OAuth
3. **Verify redirect URIs** - Must match exactly
4. **Enable email verification** - Recommended for production
