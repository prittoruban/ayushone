## 🎨 **UI Components**

### Route Info Card Structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🗺️ Route Details            [X]    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Distance: 5.42 km | Duration: 15min│
│ [Show Directions (8)]               │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Head north on Main St (200m 1m) │
│ 2. Turn right onto Oak Ave (1.2km) │
│ 3. Turn left at the traffic light  │
│ ... (scrollable)                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📊 **Data Extracted from Geoapify API**

### From API Response:

```javascript
{
  distance: 5420,      // meters
  duration: 900000,    // milliseconds
  steps: [
    {
      instruction: "Turn right onto Main Street",
      distance: 200,    // meters
      duration: 60      // seconds
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### What We Display:

- **Distance**: Formatted as "5.42 km" or "200 m"
- **Duration**: Formatted as "15 min" or "1h 25m"
- **Directions**: List of all turn-by-turn steps with distances

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### New Interface:

```typescript
interface RouteInfo {
  distance: number; // in meters
  duration: number; // in seconds
  steps: Array<{
    instruction: string;
    distance: number;
    duration: number;
  }>;
}
```

### State Management:

```typescript
const [routeInfo, setRouteInfo] = useState<RouteInfo | null>(null);
```

### Key Functions:

**1. `formatDistance(meters)`**

- Converts meters to km when >= 1000m
- Shows appropriate units

**2. `formatDuration(seconds)`**

- Converts seconds to "Xh Ym" or "X min"
- Handles hours and minutes correctly

**3. `calculateDistance(from, to)`**

- Haversine formula for straight-line distance
- Fallback when API fails
- Returns distance in meters

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### Step 1: User Clicks "Show Route"

1. Map fetches route from Geoapify API
2. API returns coordinates + route details
3. Component extracts:
   - Route polyline coordinates
   - Total distance
   - Total duration
   - Turn-by-turn steps

### Step 2: Display Route Info

1. Route drawn on map as blue line
2. Info card appears in top-right
3. Shows distance & duration in colored cards
4. "Show Directions" button available

### Step 3: View Directions

1. User clicks "Show Directions"
2. Panel expands to show all steps
3. Each step numbered and formatted
4. Scrollable if many steps

### Step 4: Clear Route

1. User clicks X button
2. Route line removed from map
3. Info card disappears
4. All route data cleared

## 🎨 **Visual Design**

### Color Scheme:

- **Blue Card**: Distance information
- **Green Card**: Duration information
- **Blue Route**: Polyline on map (weight: 5, opacity: 0.8)
- **Number Badges**: Blue circles for step numbers

### Layout:

- **Fixed Position**: Top-right corner (doesn't move with map)
- **Max Width**: 24rem (384px)
- **Max Height**: Directions scroll if > 240px
- **Z-Index**: 1000 (always on top)

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### Geoapify API Settings:

```javascript
const url = `https://api.geoapify.com/v1/routing?waypoints=${from.lat},${from.lng}|${to.lat},${to.lng}&mode=drive&apiKey=${GEOAPIFY_API_KEY}`;
```

### Route Parameters:

- **Mode**: `drive` (car/driving directions)
- **Waypoints**: Start and end coordinates
- **Response**: GeoJSON with detailed route info

## 🐛 **Error Handling**

### Scenario 1: No API Key

- Falls back to straight-line route
- Calculates distance using Haversine formula
- Shows "offline mode" in directions
- Rough time estimate: 30 km/h average speed

### Scenario 2: API Call Fails

- Same fallback as no API key
- Console logs the error
- User still sees route and estimated info

### Scenario 3: Invalid Coordinates

- Caught and logged
- Graceful fallback to straight line

## 📊 **Console Logging**

When route is fetched, console shows:

```
🗺️ Fetching route from Geoapify...
✅ Route fetched: {
  distance: "5.42 km",
  duration: "15 min",
  steps: 8
}
```

## ✨ **Examples**

### Short Route (< 1 km):

```
Distance: 850 m
Duration: 3 min
Directions:
1. Head north on Main Street (200 m • 1 min)
2. Turn right onto Oak Avenue (450 m • 1 min)

```

### Long Route (> 10 km):

```

3. Turn left onto Main Street (1.5 km • 2 min)
... (12 more steps)
```
