# ✅ Build Error Fixed!

## Issue Resolved

**Error:** `You're importing a component that needs "next/headers". That only works in a Server Component`

## Solution

Changed the import from static to dynamic import inside the function.

### Before (Broken)

```typescript
import { cookies } from "next/headers"; // ❌ Top-level import

export const createServerSupabaseClient = async () => {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  // ...
};
```

### After (Fixed)

```typescript
// No top-level import ✅

export const createServerSupabaseClient = async () => {
  // Import dynamically inside the function
  const { cookies } = await import("next/headers"); // ✅
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  // ...
};
```

## Why This Works

- Dynamic imports are only executed when the function is called
- Only happens in server-side route handlers (not during build)
- Avoids the module-level import restriction

## Server Status

✅ **Running on:** http://localhost:3001
✅ **Build:** Successful (no errors)
✅ **PKCE Fix:** Active

## Ready to Test!

### Quick Test Steps:

1. **Clear browser cookies:**

   ```
   F12 → Application → Clear site data
   ```

2. **Close and reopen browser**

3. **Test OAuth:**

   ```
   Go to: http://localhost:3001/auth/signin
   Click: "Sign in with Google"
   ```

4. **Expected result:**
   - No PKCE error ✅
   - Redirects to /profile ✅
   - Email pre-filled ✅

## Console Output to Watch For

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

```
✅ OAuth callback received with code: Yes
✅ Attempting to exchange code for session...
✅ Session established successfully user@gmail.com
```

---

## If OAuth Still Fails

### Double-check Google OAuth Configuration:

**Google Cloud Console:**

- Authorized redirect URIs must include:
  ```
  https://ldhipwazhslwjvhyvrcl.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
  ```

**Supabase Dashboard:**

- Authentication → Providers → Google
- Status: Enabled ✅
- Client ID and Secret: Filled in ✅

**Ready to test OAuth now!** 🚀
