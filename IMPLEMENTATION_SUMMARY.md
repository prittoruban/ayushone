### 7. Dependencies Installed

```json
{

  "react-leaflet": "^4.2.1",
  "@types/leaflet": "^1.9.8"
}
```

### 8. Environment Configuration

- ✅ Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
- ✅ Instructions for obtaining free API key

### 9. Documentation

- ✅ Created comprehensive setup guide: `MAP_FEATURE_README.md`
- ✅ Usage instructions for doctors and patients
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ API documentation

## 📋 To Complete Setup

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Execute in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.doctors
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS location jsonb;

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.doctors.location IS 'GPS coordinates stored as JSON: { "lat": number, "lng": number }';
```

### Step 2: Get Geoapify API Key

1. Visit: https://www.geoapify.com/
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create a project
4. Copy your API key
5. Update `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Doctors:

1. Go to "My Profile"
2. Click "Use My Location" button
3. Allow browser location access
4. See coordinates captured
5. Click "Save Profile"
6. Location is now stored in database

### For Patients:

1. Navigate to "Doctor Map"
2. See all doctors with locations as red markers
3. Click "My Location" to show your position (blue marker)
4. Click any doctor marker to see their details
5. Click "Show Route" to see path from your location to doctor
6. Route is displayed using Geoapify Routing API

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

```
User Browser
    ↓
Navigator.geolocation API (GPS)
    ↓
Doctor Profile Page → Save Location
    ↓
POST /api/doctors (with location data)
    ↓
Supabase (doctors.location JSONB column)
    ↓
GET /api/doctors (returns doctors with locations)
    ↓
Map Page → MapView Component
    ↓
Leaflet + React-Leaflet (Map Display)
    ↓
Geoapify Routing API (Route Calculation)
    ↓
Display Route on Map
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### TypeScript Error on MapView import

**Error**: "Cannot find module '@/components/MapView'"
**Solution**: This is a TypeScript cache issue. The file exists. Solutions:

1. Restart VS Code
2. Restart TypeScript server (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "Restart TS Server")
3. Delete `.next` folder and restart dev server

### Map not displaying

**Solution**:

- Ensure dev server is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Leaflet CSS is loading

### Location permission denied

**Solution**:

- Guide user to browser settings
- Show instructions for enabling location
- Provide manual lat/lng input as fallback
