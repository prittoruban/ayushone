# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Map Feature

## ✅ What's Been Done

I've successfully implemented a complete doctor location map feature for your AYUSH ONE healthcare platform! Here's what's ready:

### 🎯 Core Features Implemented

1. **📍 Location Database Column**

   - Added `location` JSONB column to `doctors` table
   - Stores GPS coordinates as `{ lat: number, lng: number }`

2. **🗺️ Interactive Map Page** (`/map`)

   - Displays all doctors with locations as red markers
   - Shows user location as blue marker
   - Click markers to see doctor details in popups
   - Real-time route planning with Geoapify API
   - Responsive design for mobile devices

3. **👨‍⚕️ Doctor Profile Location Capture**

   - "Use My Location" button to capture GPS coordinates
   - Visual feedback showing captured coordinates
   - Automatic save with profile updates

4. **🧭 Navigation Integration**
   - Added "Doctor Map" link to main navigation
   - Easy access from anywhere in the app

## 🏃‍♂️ 3-Step Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Open your Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.doctors ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS location jsonb;
```

### Step 2: Get Geoapify API Key

1. Go to: https://www.geoapify.com/
2. Sign up (free, no credit card)
3. Copy your API key
4. Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
